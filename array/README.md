# Arrays in Java

This section contains problems related to arrays and various methods to solve them.

## Problems

1. **Find the maximum and minimum elements in an array**
   - Iterative approach using a for loop
   - Using divide and conquer

2. **Reverse an array**
   - Iterative approach using a for loop
   - Using two pointers
   - Using recursion

3. **Find the "Kth" max and min element of an array**
   - Sorting the array and returning the k-th element
   - Using a min-heap or max-heap
   - Quickselect algorithm

4. **Sort an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s**
   - Counting sort
   - Dutch National Flag algorithm

5. **Move all negative numbers to the beginning and positive to the end**
   - Two-pointer approach
   - Partitioning approach similar to quicksort
   - Using extra space
