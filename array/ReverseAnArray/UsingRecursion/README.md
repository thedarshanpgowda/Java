## Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity: O(n)

- The function makes a single pass through the array, swapping elements until the entire array is reversed.

### Space Complexity: O(n)

- Due to the recursive calls, the space complexity is O(n) because of the call stack usage, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
