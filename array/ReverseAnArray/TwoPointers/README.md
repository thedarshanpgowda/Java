# Array Reversal Using Two-Pointer Technique

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to reverse an array using the two-pointer technique in Java. The two-pointer approach is more efficient than a simple iterative approach that creates a new array. The two-pointer technique swaps elements in place, reducing memory usage and improving performance.

## Benefits of the Two-Pointer Technique

### Memory Efficiency
- The two-pointer technique reverses the array in place, meaning it does not require additional memory to store a new array. This reduces the overall memory footprint of the program.

### Performance Improvement
- By avoiding the creation of a new array, the two-pointer technique minimizes the overhead associated with array creation and copying. This results in faster execution, especially for large arrays.

### Simplicity
- The two-pointer technique uses a straightforward approach of swapping elements, making the code easy to understand and maintain.

## How the Two-Pointer Technique is Implemented

### Initialization
- Two pointers, `left` and `right`, are initialized. `left` starts at the beginning of the array (index `0`) and `right` starts at the end of the array (index `array.length - 1`).

### Swapping Elements
- The elements at the `left` and `right` pointers are swapped.
- After swapping, the `left` pointer is incremented (moves towards the center) and the `right` pointer is decremented (also moves towards the center).

### Termination Condition
- The process continues until the `left` pointer is no longer less than the `right` pointer. At this point, the array is fully reversed.

## Usage
To use this implementation, create an instance of the `TwoPointerClass` and call the `returnsAnArray` method with the array you want to reverse. The method will return the reversed array.
